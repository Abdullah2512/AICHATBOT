# Student Grade Tracker (Java)

This is a basic Java program I made to keep track of student grades. It runs in the console and asks the user to enter names and marks for multiple students. After all entries, it shows the average, highest, and lowest marks along with the names.

## Features
- Takes input of student names and their marks
- Finds average grade
- Shows which student has the highest and lowest marks
- Displays a small report at the end

## Tools Used
- Java
- Scanner class (for input)
- ArrayList (to store data)

## Why I Made This
This was a small project to improve my basic Java skills, especially working with arrays and loops. It also helped me practice getting user input and doing simple calculations.

## How to Run
Just compile and run the file using any Java IDE or terminal. It will ask for number of students and then take inputs.

# Java AI Chatbot (Console)

This is a simple chatbot made in Java. It's a rule-based bot, so it gives replies based on keywords typed by the user. It runs in the terminal and you can talk to it by typing anything.

## What It Can Do
- Replies to basic greetings like "hi", "hello"
- Answers common questions like "what is AI" or "who made you"
- Has a goodbye message when user types "bye"
- Handles unknown inputs with a default response

## Why I Made This
I wanted to try making a chatbot without using any libraries or frameworks. So I used basic string matching and simple logic to handle different questions. It was helpful for learning how bots work and how to use conditions in Java.

## How to Use
Just run the program. It will start a chat loop. Type messages and see what the bot says. Type "bye" to exit.

## Tech Stack
- Java
- Scanner (for input)
- If-else logic (for replies)
