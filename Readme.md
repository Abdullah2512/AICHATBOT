# Java AI Chatbot (Console)

This is a simple chatbot made in Java. It's a rule-based bot, so it gives replies based on keywords typed by the user. It runs in the terminal and you can talk to it by typing anything.

## What It Can Do
- Replies to basic greetings like "hi", "hello"
- Answers common questions like "what is AI" or "who made you"
- Has a goodbye message when user types "bye"
- Handles unknown inputs with a default response

## Why I Made This
I wanted to try making a chatbot without using any libraries or frameworks. So I used basic string matching and simple logic to handle different questions. It was helpful for learning how bots work and how to use conditions in Java.

## How to Use
Just run the program. It will start a chat loop. Type messages and see what the bot says. Type "bye" to exit.
